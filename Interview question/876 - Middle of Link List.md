Let me explain the time and space complexity of this algorithm in a way that helps build a clear understanding.
Time Complexity: O(n)
Let's understand why this is O(n) by breaking down what happens in the code:

First, let's look at how many steps our algorithm takes:

The fast pointer moves two steps at a time
The slow pointer moves one step at a time
The loop continues until the fast pointer reaches the end


If we have n nodes in our linked list:

The fast pointer will reach the end after approximately n/2 iterations
This is because it's moving twice as fast, so it only needs half as many iterations
In each iteration, we're doing constant time operations (just moving pointers)


For example, with a list of 6 nodes:
CopyStep 1: 1→2→3→4→5→6
       S   F
Step 2: 1→2→3→4→5→6
           S   F
Step 3: 1→2→3→4→5→6
             S   F
We only needed 3 iterations (n/2) to reach the end.

Space Complexity: O(1)
The space complexity is constant because:

We only use two pointers (slow and fast)
These pointers take the same amount of space regardless of input size
We're not creating any additional data structures that grow with input

For comparison, imagine if we had solved this by:

Converting the linked list to an array first
Finding the middle by index
Converting back to a linked list
That would have been O(n) space complexity because we'd need extra space proportional to the input size.

Our solution is elegant because it:

Uses only pointer manipulation (no extra space)
Finds the middle in a single pass through the list
Never needs to store the length or create additional data structures
